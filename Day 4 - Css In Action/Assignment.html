            <hr>
            <p class="p1">This is the first paragraph of my blog post. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences
                with you all.
                In
                this post, I wil be talking about my day.</p>

            <p>Let's start with my morning. I woke up early and had a cup of coffee. Then, I decided to go for a walk in
                the
                park. It was a
                beautiful sunny day, and the birds were singing. I saw many people walking their dogs and children
                playing.
                It
                was very
                refreshing.</p>
